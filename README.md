# pw5-compiled-binaries
This repository hosts precompiled ARM Linux binaries for the Kindle Paperwhite 5.
I compiled it from sources and they are all static. You could use them, do whatever you like.
I don't care. you guys could literally report me and I won't care.
Warning: You must get your own magic.mgc for file.
